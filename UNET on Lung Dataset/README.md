This week, you are going to use U-NET on a lung dataset. UNET 

U-Net is a specialized convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture designed primarily for image segmentation, where the goal is to classify each pixel in an image into a category. 

In this model we will attempt to use UNET to identify lung organs in chest X-rays with high accuracy.
